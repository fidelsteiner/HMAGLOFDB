!DATASET VARIABLES

Variables can either bei alphanumerical (A/N), random text (TXT), text from a prescribed list (STR) or an integer (INT). For all integer options, '+' denotes that impact was >0 but numbers are unavailable.

VAR	FORMAT	DESCRIPTION	UNIT
GF_ID	A/N	Unique identifier for each event with the format GFXXXXXNYYYYYE_NNNN where X stands for latitude, Y longitude and N is an alphanumerical combination from the first three lake name letters and the chronological counter of GLOF occurence.	-
Year_approx	TXT	Text describing time period when GLOF happened when no exact year is available.	-
Year_exact	INT	Exact year the GLOF happened.	-
Month	INT	Exact month the GLOF happened	-
Day	INT	Exact day the GLOF happened. If GLOF took plave over multiple days, the last day is mentioned.
Lake_name	TXT	Locally used lake name. If not available 'Unnamed'. Note that Co/Tsho/Pokhari are the regional words for '(small) lake'. The speling is used according to the country the lake lies in. Separate spelling is used here, i.e. 'Lure Co' over 'Lureco'	-
Glacier_name	TXT	Locally used glacier name. If not available 'Unnamed'.	-
GL_ID	A/N	Identifier for lake following the ICIMOD database on glacial lakes in the HKH. If visible but not mapped 'not mapped', if an ephermeral lake 'ephemeral', if no detectable trace of a lake 'no lake'.	-
LakeDB_ID	INT	Lake database identifier (1 - this study/ICIMOD, 2 - Wang2020 (1990), 3 - Wang2020 (2018), 4 - Chen2021); see the paper for a discussion of the inventories
G_ID	A/N	Identifier for glacier, upstream of the glacial lake, following the GLIMS database. If visible but not mapped 'not mapped', if no detectable trace of a glacier 'no glacier'.	-
Lat_lake	INT	Latitude of lake.	Decimal
Lon_lake	INT	Longitude of lake.	Decimal
Elev_lake	INT	Elevation of lake.	m a.s.l.
Lat_impact	INT	Latitude of furthest observed impact.	Decimal
Lon_impact	INT	Longitude of furthest observed impact.	Decimal
Elev_impact	INT	Elevation of furthest observed imapct.	m a.s.l.
Impact_type	STR	Evidence for furthest impact, either observed high flow ('Observation') or visible deposit from satellite imagery ('Deposit').	-
Lake_type	STR	'Moraine dammed','Ice dammed', 'Bedrock', 'Landslide dammed', 'Englacial','Supraglacial','Unknown' -
Transboundary	STR	Defines if lake is draining into another country anywhere along the downstream river reach ('Y') or not ('N'). Does not make a statement about whether the GLOF itself was transboundary.	-
Repeat	STR	'Y' if the same lake drained before or after, 'N' if a unique event.	-
Region_RGI	STR	Identifier for RGI region the GLOF occured in, following the RGI_CODE
Region_HiMAP	STR	Identifier for HiMAP region the GLOF occured in, following the OBJECTID
Country	STR	Country the GLOF started in	-
Province	STR	Level 1 order province name of GLOF occurence	- 
River_Basin	STR	Highest order river basin name the GLOF drained into. In transboundary cases the local name is used, hence the same river basin may appear under two different names. A list of respective translations is provided below. Individual name and local term for 'river' is written separately, i.e. 'Nian Chu' rather than 'Nianchu'. Exception is when the ending of '-qu' is used.
Cause	STR	Reason for the GLOF happening; see list below.	-
Area	INT	Lake area from inventory or on last available image before drainage	m2
Volume	INT	Discharged volume (in most cases estimated from observed lake area change)	m3
Discharge_water	INT	Observed or estimated discharge of water	m3 s-1
Discharge_solid	INT	Observed or estimated discharge of solid material	m3 s-1
Impact	TXT	Description of observed impacts downstream	-
Lives_total	INT	Total lives lost	-
Lives_male	INT	Total male lives lost	-
Lives_female	INT	Total female lives lost	-
Lives_disabilities	INT	Total lives of people with disabilities lost	-
Injured_total	INT	Total injured	-
Injured_male	INT	Total male injured	-
Injured_female	INT	Total female injured	-
Injured_disabilities	INT	Total people with disabilities injured	-
Displaced_total	INT	Total displaced	-
Displaced_male	INT	Total male displaced	-
Displaced_female	INT	Total female displaced	-
Displaced_disabilities	INT	Total people with disabilities displaced	-
Livestock	INT	Total livestock killed (cattle, horses, mules etc; does not count poultry or fish)	-
Residential_destroyed	INT	Total number of residential houses destroyed	-
Commercial_destroyed	INT	Total number of commercial houses destroyed	-
Residential_damaged	INT	Total number of residential houses damaged	-
Commercial_damaged	INT	Total number of commercial houses damaged	-
Infra	TXT	Information on any other infrastructure or assests destroyed or damaged.	-
Agricultural	INT	Total agricultural land destroyed or seriously damaged.	m2
Hydropower	INT	Total installed hydropower capacity destroyed	MW
Econ_damage	INT	Total quantified damage in monetary terms.	USD
Ref_scientific	TXT	Citation to scientific documentation of event.	-
Ref_other	TXT	Link to other sources that documented the event.	-
Remarks	TXT	Any other notes.
