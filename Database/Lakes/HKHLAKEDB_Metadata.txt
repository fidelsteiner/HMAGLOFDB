!DATASET VARIABLES

The dataset includes .shp files for the years 2000, 2005, 2010 and 2020. Methods of how the lakes were delineated are described in http://lib.icimod.org/record/33736. The original dataset encompasses mapped lakes for the year 2005 (+/- 2years), while the same approach was used for the other three timesteps subsequently.

Major basin name 	string 	text 	Drainage basin name based on maps and literature reviews
Basin name 		string 	text 	Drainage basin name based on maps and literature reviews
Sub-basin name 		string 	text 	Drainage basin name based on maps and literature reviews
Longitude 		string 	DMS 	Longitude of centre of glacial lake
Latitude 		string 	DMS 	Latitude of centre of glacial lake
GLIMS_ID 		string 	GLXXXXXXEYYYYYN 	Combination of longitude (X) and latitude (Y) of the centroid of the lake polygon. GL = glacial lake, E = East, N = North.
Altitude 		integer 	metre above mean sea level (masl) 	Water level of glacial lake. Extracted from SRTM
Area 			float 	km2 	Area of glacial lake. Calculated based on the Albers equal area conic projection
Gl_Type 		string 	- 	Type of glacial lake
Image_ID 		string 	Image 	ID same as downloaded images (includes row, path, and data of images acquisition)
Date 			date 	YYYYMMDD 	Date of the image used for mapping GL
