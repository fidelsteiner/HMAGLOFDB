description: |-
  Historic GLOFs in HMA. The latest development version can be accessed on https://github.com/fidelsteiner/HMAGLOFDB. However this data is not necessarily quality controlled before an official release. Issues or new events can be reported by contacting the authors (jff.steiner@gmail.com). For all integer options, '+' denotes that impact was >0 but numbers are unavailable.
