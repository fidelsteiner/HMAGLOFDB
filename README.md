Database of all GLOFs in high mountain Asia

This repository includes the development version of the database as well as code that was used to analyse the database for the associated publication ([https://doi.org/10.5194/essd-2022-395](https://doi.org/10.5194/essd-15-3941-2023)). The database is also updated annually on the RDS hosted at ICIMOD (https://doi.org/10.26066/RDS.1973283).

The GLOF database ('...Database/GLOFs') includes the actual database ('HMAGLOFDB.csv'), a database of GLOFs that were mentioned in previous publications but removed here for lack of evidence ('HMAGLOFDB_removed.csv') and a MetaData file ('HMAGLOFDB_Metadata.yml').

The database has been quality controlled up to 2023/12/31. Events with a later date in the database need to be evaluated and cross checked.
