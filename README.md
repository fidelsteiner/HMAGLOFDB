Database of all GLOFs in high mountain Asia

The repository includes the most up to date database as well as code that was used to analyse the database for the associated publication (XXXX). 

The database structure comprises a database on lakes (HKHLAKEDB; '...Database/Lakes'), including mapped lake outlines from 2000, 2005, 2010 and 2020. Lake outlines are not planned to be updated in future under this repository.

The GLOF database ('...Database/GLOFs') includes the actual database ('HMAGLOFDB_v01.csv'), a database of GLOFs that were mentioned in previous publications but removed here for lack of evidence ('HMAGLOFDB_removed.csv'), a list of references pointing to sources from where events were collected ('HMAGLOFDG_CIT.docx') and a MetaData file ('HMAGLOFDB_Metadata.txt').

The database has been quality controlled up to 2022/07/31. Events with a later date in the database, need to be evaluated and cross checked.
